This `ember-cli` addon adds a simple, highly performant Ember Mixin to your app. This Mixin, when added to a `View` or `Component` (collectively referred to as `Components`), will allow you to check if that `Component` has entered the browser's viewport. By default, the Mixin uses the `IntersectionObserver` API if it detects it in your user's browser â€“ failing which, it fallsback to using `requestAnimationFrame`, then if not available, the Ember run loop and event listeners.

# Installation

```
ember install ember-in-viewport
```

## Usage
Usage is simple. First, add the Mixin to your `Component`:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import InViewportMixin from 'ember-in-viewport';

export default Component.extend(InViewportMixin, {
  // ...
});
```

### Basic usage
#### Available hooks
##### `didEnterViewport`, `didExitViewport`
These hooks fire once whenever the `Component` enters or exits the viewport. You can handle them the same way you would handle any other native Ember hook:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import InViewportMixin from 'ember-in-viewport';

export default Component.extend(InViewportMixin, {
  didEnterViewport() {
    console.log('entered');
  },

  didExitViewport() {
    console.log('exited');
  }
});
```

##### `didScroll(up,down,left,right)`
The `didScroll` hook fires when an element enters the viewport. For example, if you scrolled down in order to move the element in the viewport, the `didScroll` hook would fire and also receive the direction as a string. You can then handle it like another hook as in the above example.

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import InViewportMixin from 'ember-in-viewport';

export default Component.extend(InViewportMixin, {
  didScroll(direction) {
    console.log(direction); // 'up' || 'down' || 'left' || 'right'
  }
});
```

##### `viewportEntered`
To apply an `.active` class to your `Component` when it enters the viewport, you can simply bind the `active` class to the mixed in property `viewportEntered`, like so:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import InViewportMixin from 'ember-in-viewport';

export default Component.extend(InViewportMixin, {
  classNameBindings: [ 'viewportEntered:active' ]
});
```

##### `viewportExited`
This hook fires whenever the `Component` leaves the viewport.

### Advanced usage (options)
The mixin comes with some options. Due to the way listeners and `IntersectionObserver API` or `requestAnimationFrame` is setup, you'll have to override the options this way:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import InViewportMixin from 'ember-in-viewport';
import { setProperties }  from '@ember/object';

export default Component.extend(InViewportMixin, {
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    setProperties(this, {
      viewportEnabled                 : true,
      viewportUseRAF                  : true,
      viewportSpy                     : false,
      viewportScrollSensitivity       : 1,
      viewportRefreshRate             : 150,
      intersectionThreshold           : 0,
      scrollableArea                  : null,
      viewportTolerance: {
        top    : 50,
        bottom : 50,
        left   : 20,
        right  : 20
      }
    });
  }
});
```

- `viewportEnabled: boolean`

  Default: `true`

  Set to false to have no listeners registered. Useful if you have components that function with either viewport listening on or off.

- `viewportUseIntersectionObserver: boolean`

  Default: Depends on browser

  Read-only

  The Mixin by default will use the IntersectionObserver API. If IntersectionObserver is not supported in the target browser, ember-in-viewport will fallback to rAF.  We prevent users from explicitly setting this to `true` as browsers lacking support for IntersectionObserver will throw an error.

  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/thresholds#Browser_compatibility)

- `intersectionThreshold: decimal or array`

  Default: 0

  A single number or array of numbers between 0.0 and 1.0.  A value of 0.0 means the target will be visible when the first pixel enters the viewport.  A value of 1.0 means the entire target must be visible to fire the didEnterViewport hook.
  Similarily, [0, .25, .5, .75, 1] will fire didEnterViewport every 25% of the target that is visible.
  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API#Thresholds)

  Some notes:
    - If the target is offscreen, you will get a notification via `didExitViewport` that the target is initially offscreen.  Similarily, this is possible to notify if onscreen when your site loads.
    - If intersectionThreshold is set to anything greater than 0, you will not see `didExitViewport` hook fired due to our use of the `isIntersecting` property.  See last comment here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=713819 for purpose of `isIntersecting`
    - To get around the above issue and have `didExitViewport` fire, set your `intersectionThreshold` to `[0, 1.0]`.  When set to just `1.0`, when the element is 99% visible and still has isIntersecting as true, when the element leaves the viewport, the element isn't applicable to the observer anymore, so the callback isn't called again.
    - If your intersectionThreshold is set to 0 you will get notified if the target `didEnterViewport` and `didExitViewport` at the appropriate time.

- `scrollableArea`

  Default: null

  A CSS selector for the scrollable area.  e.g. `".my-list"`

- `viewportUseRAF: boolean`

  Default: Depends on browser

  As its name suggests, if this is `true` and the IntersectionObserver API is not available in the target browser, the Mixin will use `requestAnimationFrame`. Unless you want to force enabling or disabling this, you won't need to override this option.

- `viewportSpy: boolean`

  Default: `false`

  When `true`, the Mixin will continually watch the `Component` and re-fire hooks whenever it enters or leaves the viewport. Because this is expensive, this behaviour is opt-in. When false, the Mixin will only watch the `Component` until it enters the viewport once, and then it sets `viewportEntered` to `true` (permanently), and unbinds listeners. This reduces the load on the Ember run loop and your application.

  NOTE: If using IntersectionObserver (default), viewportSpy should always be set to true.  However, browsers (Safari) that don't currently support IntersectionObserver, this addon will use rAF which, depending on your use case, the default of `false` may be acceptable.

- `viewportScrollSensitivity: number`

  Default: `1`

  This value determines the degree of sensitivity (in `px`) in which a DOM element is considered to have scrolled into the viewport. For example, if you set `viewportScrollSensitivity` to `10`, the `didScroll{...}` hooks would only fire if the scroll was greater than `10px`.

- `viewportRefreshRate: number`

  Default: `100`

  If `IntersectionObserver` and `requestAnimationFrame` is not present, this value determines how often the Mixin checks your component to determine whether or not it has entered or left the viewport. The lower this number, the more often it checks, and the more load is placed on your application. Generally, you'll want this value between `100` to `300`, which is about the range at which people consider things to be "real-time".

  This value also affects how often the Mixin checks scroll direction.

- `viewportTolerance: object`

  Default: `{ top: 0, left: 0, bottom: 0, right: 0 }`

  This option determines how accurately the `Component` needs to be within the viewport for it to be considered as entered.  Add bottom margin to preemptively trigger didEnterViewport.

  For IntersectionObserver, this property interpolates to [rootMargin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin).
  For rAF, this property will use `bottom` tolerance and measure against the height of the container to determine when to trigger didEnterViewport.

  Also, if your sentinel (component that uses this mixin) is a zero-height element, ensure that the sentinel actually is able to enter the viewport.

### Global options

You can set application wide defaults for `ember-in-viewport` in your app (they are still manually overridable inside of a Component). To set new defaults, just add a config object to `config/environment.js`, like so:

```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    // ...
    viewportConfig: {
      viewportEnabled                 : false,
      viewportUseRAF                  : true,
      viewportSpy                     : false,
      viewportScrollSensitivity       : 1,
      viewportRefreshRate             : 100,
      viewportListeners               : [],
      intersectionThreshold           : 0,
      scrollableArea                  : null,
      viewportTolerance: {
        top    : 0,
        left   : 0,
        bottom : 0,
        right  : 0
      }
    }
  };
};

Note if you want to disable right and left in-viewport triggers, set these values to `Infinity`.
```
